    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are **very exciting and rapid developments in drug discovery powered by AI**. It's one of the most dynamic areas of AI application in healthcare. Here's a breakdown of some of the key new trends and advancements:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Big Story:** This is perhaps the most talked-about area. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other generative AI models are not just analyzing existing data but are actively **designing entirely new molecular structures** from scratch.\n",
      "*   **How it Works:** These models are trained on vast datasets of known drug molecules and their properties. They can then be prompted to generate molecules with specific characteristics – for example, a molecule that can bind to a particular protein target, has a high likelihood of being absorbed by the body, or has minimal toxicity.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** Companies are announcing successful preclinical candidates designed by AI, with some even moving into early-stage human trials. This has the potential to drastically shorten the time and reduce the cost of the initial drug design phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Going Beyond Genomics:** While genomics was an early driver, AI is now integrating multiple \"omics\" data (proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics) and real-world evidence (RWE) from electronic health records.\n",
      "*   **Identifying Complex Disease Pathways:** AI can sift through these massive, multi-modal datasets to uncover complex biological pathways that are implicated in diseases. This helps researchers identify novel and previously unappreciated drug targets.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":** AI models are also being developed to predict whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning if a molecule can be designed to effectively interact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. AI-Powered *In Silico* Screening and Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Virtual Screening on Steroids:** AI significantly enhances traditional virtual screening. Instead of just checking if existing compounds bind to a target, AI can predict how well a *generated* or *hypothetical* molecule will bind.\n",
      "*   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** A crucial aspect of drug development is predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET). AI models are becoming increasingly accurate at forecasting these properties early on, allowing developers to discard unpromising molecules much sooner.\n",
      "*   **Lead Optimization:** Once a \"hit\" molecule is found, AI can help rapidly optimize its structure to improve efficacy, reduce side effects, and enhance pharmacokinetic properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI is excellent at finding patterns in large datasets. It can analyze existing drug databases, scientific literature, and patient data to identify drugs approved for one condition that might be effective against another.\n",
      "*   **Faster and Cheaper:** Drug repurposing is significantly faster and cheaper than developing a new drug from scratch, as the safety and some pharmacokinetic data often already exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Enhancing Clinical Trial Design and Success Prediction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can identify patient subgroups that are more likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and efficient clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** While still an emerging area, AI is being explored to predict the likelihood of success for a drug candidate in clinical trials based on preclinical data, mechanism of action, and historical trial data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Companies and Trends to Watch:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Many biotech startups and established pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI for drug discovery. You'll see news from companies like:\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Nvidia:** While not a drug discovery company, their AI computing platforms are foundational to many of these advancements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, AI is not just an incremental improvement in drug discovery; it's a paradigm shift.** It's moving from a largely trial-and-error process to a more predictive, data-driven, and AI-guided approach, with the ultimate goal of bringing more effective medicines to patients faster and at a lower cost.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **\"Accelerated Target Identification and Validation\"** development in AI for drug discovery. This is a fundamental and crucial step, as finding the right target is the starting point for developing any new drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing this area:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Traditional Challenge:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, identifying and validating a drug target has been an arduous, lengthy, and often serendipitous process. It involved:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Deep Biological Expertise:** Relying on the accumulated knowledge and intuition of highly skilled biologists and researchers.\n",
      "*   **Extensive Literature Review:** Sifting through mountains of scientific papers, often manually.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Experiments:** Numerous time-consuming and expensive experiments to test hypotheses.\n",
      "*   **Focus on Well-Studied Pathways:** Often, research focused on targets that were already well-understood, limiting the discovery of novel mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Transforming Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI brings several key capabilities to overcome these challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Massive Data Integration and Analysis:**\n",
      "    *   **Multi-Omics Data:** AI can integrate and analyze data from various biological \"omics\" layers simultaneously:\n",
      "        *   **Genomics:** DNA sequencing data to identify genetic mutations linked to disease.\n",
      "        *   **Transcriptomics:** RNA expression data to understand which genes are active.\n",
      "        *   **Proteomics:** Protein expression and interaction data, as proteins are often the direct targets of drugs.\n",
      "        *   **Metabolomics:** Data on small molecules involved in metabolism.\n",
      "    *   **Real-World Evidence (RWE):** AI can analyze anonymized data from electronic health records (EHRs), insurance claims, and patient registries to identify correlations between specific biological markers and disease progression or treatment response in large patient populations.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Literature and Patents:** AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) can scan and extract insights from millions of research papers, patents, and clinical trial databases, identifying novel connections and hypotheses that humans might miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Uncovering Complex, Non-Linear Relationships:**\n",
      "    *   **Beyond Simple Correlations:** Biological systems are incredibly complex. AI, particularly deep learning models, can identify subtle, non-linear relationships between different biological factors that are not apparent through traditional statistical methods. For example, it can understand how a combination of genetic variants, protein levels, and environmental factors might contribute to disease risk.\n",
      "    *   **Systems Biology Approach:** AI enables a more holistic, systems-level understanding of disease, moving beyond looking at individual genes or proteins in isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Generation and Prioritization:**\n",
      "    *   **Suggesting New Targets:** Based on the integrated data, AI can generate novel hypotheses about potential drug targets. It can suggest that a particular protein, pathway, or even a specific mutation could be a promising intervention point for a disease.\n",
      "    *   **Prioritizing Promising Targets:** Crucially, AI doesn't just suggest targets; it can also rank them based on various criteria:\n",
      "        *   **Biological Rationale:** How strong is the evidence linking this target to the disease?\n",
      "        *   **\"Druggability\":** Is this target likely to be amenable to drug development? (e.g., does it have a binding pocket where a small molecule could interact?)\n",
      "        *   **Safety Profile:** Is there evidence that modulating this target might lead to significant off-target side effects?\n",
      "        *   **Novelty:** Is this a well-trodden path, or a truly novel area that could lead to breakthrough therapies?\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Accelerated Validation:**\n",
      "    *   **In Silico Validation:** Before costly lab experiments, AI can perform \"in silico\" validation. For example, it can predict the impact of modulating a target by analyzing cellular pathways or simulating biological responses.\n",
      "    *   **Guiding Experimental Design:** The insights from AI can help researchers design more targeted and efficient laboratory experiments, focusing their resources on the most promising hypotheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact and Future Outlook:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Opening Up New Therapeutic Areas:** AI is enabling the exploration of targets in diseases that were previously considered \"undruggable\" due to a lack of understanding or apparent targets.\n",
      "*   **Faster Time to First-in-Human:** By accelerating the initial discovery phase, AI is contributing to a faster pipeline of potential new drugs entering clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Precision Medicine:** Identifying targets that are relevant to specific patient subgroups is key to developing more personalized and effective treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI acts as an incredibly powerful magnifying glass and pattern-recognition engine for the vast and complex world of biology. It allows researchers to see connections and generate insights that were previously beyond human capacity, thereby dramatically accelerating the critical first step in bringing new medicines to patients.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n",
    "2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n",
    "3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n"
