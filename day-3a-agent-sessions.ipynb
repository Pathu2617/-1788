    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

To give you the most relevant \"latest news,\" I need a little more context. However, I can provide you with a summary of some of the most significant and recent trends and breakthroughs:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Areas of AI Advancement in Healthcare:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug Discovery and Development:**\n",
      "    *   **Accelerated Research:** AI is dramatically speeding up the identification of potential drug candidates, predicting molecular interactions, and optimizing clinical trial design. Companies are using AI to find new uses for existing drugs and to design entirely novel therapeutics.\n",
      "    *   **Personalized Medicine:** AI is helping to tailor drug treatments to individual patients based on their genetic makeup, lifestyle, and disease characteristics.\n",
      "*   **Diagnostics and Imaging:**\n",
      "    *   **Enhanced Image Analysis:** AI algorithms are becoming increasingly adept at detecting subtle patterns in medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, pathology slides) that might be missed by the human eye, leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses for conditions like cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular diseases.\n",
      "    *   **Predictive Diagnostics:** AI is being used to predict a patient's risk of developing certain diseases in the future based on their medical history, genetic predispositions, and even wearable device data.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Treatment and Patient Management:**\n",
      "    *   **Treatment Optimization:** AI can analyze vast amounts of patient data to recommend the most effective treatment plans, adjust dosages, and predict treatment responses.\n",
      "    *   **Remote Patient Monitoring:** AI-powered tools are enabling better monitoring of patients outside of clinical settings, identifying early signs of deterioration, and alerting healthcare providers to intervene.\n",
      "    *   **Virtual Assistants and Chatbots:** AI chatbots are being used for patient education, appointment scheduling, answering common health questions, and providing mental health support.\n",
      "*   **Operational Efficiency and Administrative Tasks:**\n",
      "    *   **Streamlining Workflows:** AI is automating administrative tasks such as medical coding, claims processing, and appointment scheduling, freeing up healthcare professionals' time for patient care.\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most active and exciting areas for AI in healthcare right now. Here are some of the key new developments and trends:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Accelerated Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Genomic and Proteomic Data Analysis:** AI can sift through massive datasets of genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic information to identify novel biological targets that are implicated in disease pathways. This is far more efficient than traditional methods.\n",
      "*   **Network Biology:** AI helps to map complex biological networks, understanding how different molecules and pathways interact. This allows researchers to pinpoint critical nodes that, when targeted, can have a significant impact on disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. De Novo Drug Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Generative Models:** This is a major breakthrough. AI models (like generative adversarial networks - GANs, and variational autoencoders - VAEs) can now *design* entirely new molecular structures from scratch that are predicted to bind to specific targets and possess desirable drug-like properties (e.g., solubility, low toxicity).\n",
      "*   **Property Prediction:** AI models are getting better at predicting not just binding affinity but also crucial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body, and its effects).\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze databases of existing drugs, their known mechanisms of action, and their effects on various diseases. This allows for the rapid identification of drugs that could be repurposed for new therapeutic indications, significantly cutting down development time and cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Optimizing Pre-clinical Testing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI is being used to predict how well a drug candidate will perform in lab tests and animal models, and importantly, to predict potential toxic side effects. This helps to prioritize the most promising candidates and de-prioritize those likely to fail, saving significant resources.\n",
      "*   **Reducing Animal Testing:** By improving the accuracy of in-silico (computer-based) predictions, AI can potentially reduce the reliance on animal testing in the early stages of drug development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Revolutionizing Clinical Trials:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Patient Selection:** AI can identify patient subgroups most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and successful clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Trial Design Optimization:** AI can help design more efficient clinical trial protocols, predict enrollment rates, and even identify potential sites for trials.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** Some AI models are being developed to predict the likelihood of success for a clinical trial based on early data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Examples and Companies in the Spotlight:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** They've been very public about their AI-driven drug discovery process, including having an AI-designed drug enter human clinical trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
      "*   **Exscientia:** Another leader in AI-driven drug discovery, Exscientia has a pipeline of AI-designed molecules and partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies.\n",
      "*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** They use AI and automation to map cell biology and discover new therapeutic targets.\n",
      "*   **Atomwise:** Focuses on using AI for small molecule drug discovery.\n",
      "*   **BenevolentAI:** Employs AI to analyze biomedical information and identify potential drug targets and therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges Remain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these advances, challenges persist. Ensuring the quality and comprehensiveness of the data used to train AI models is crucial. Furthermore, the \"black box\" nature of some AI algorithms can be a barrier to full trust and adoption in a highly regulated field. Regulatory pathways for AI-discovered drugs are still evolving.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, AI is not just assisting in drug discovery; it's fundamentally transforming it, making it faster, more precise, and potentially more cost-effective. We're seeing a shift from screening existing libraries to designing novel molecules, and AI is at the heart of this revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to **De Novo Drug Design**! This is indeed a very exciting area where AI is making significant strides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me break down what \"De Novo Drug Design\" means and why AI is so impactful here:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is De Novo Drug Design?**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De novo\" is a Latin phrase meaning \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\" In the context of drug discovery, de novo drug design refers to the process of **designing entirely new molecular structures** that have never existed before, with the specific goal of them being effective drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, drug discovery often involved:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Screening:** Testing thousands or millions of existing compounds (from natural sources or libraries) to see if any have activity against a disease target.\n",
      "*   **Modifying:** Taking a \"hit\" compound found through screening and chemically modifying it to improve its properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "De novo design aims to bypass much of this by **generating novel molecules that are optimized from the ground up** for desired characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing De Novo Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, particularly **generative AI models**, are the game-changers here. These models learn the fundamental rules of chemistry and molecular structure and can then generate new molecules that adhere to those rules and possess specific desired properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Learning the Chemical Space:** AI models are trained on vast datasets of known molecules, their structures, and their properties. This allows the AI to learn:\n",
      "    *   **Valid Chemical Structures:** What combinations of atoms and bonds are chemically stable and make sense.\n",
      "    *   **Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR):** How changes in a molecule's structure affect its biological activity (e.g., how well it binds to a target protein).\n",
      "    *   **Physicochemical Properties:** How properties like solubility, lipophilicity, and molecular weight are related to structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Generative Models:** The core of AI-driven de novo design lies in generative AI. Common types include:\n",
      "    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks, a \"generator\" that creates new molecules, and a \"discriminator\" that tries to tell if a molecule is real or generated. Through competition, the generator gets better at creating realistic and novel molecules.\n",
      "    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of molecules and can then decode points in this space back into new molecular structures.\n",
      "    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used in conjunction with generative models. The AI is \"rewarded\" for generating molecules that meet specific criteria (e.g., high binding affinity, good solubility, low predicted toxicity).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Defining Design Goals (Optimization):** Researchers define the desired properties for the new molecule. This could include:\n",
      "    *   **High Affinity for a Specific Target:** The molecule should bind very strongly to the protein or enzyme that is causing the disease.\n",
      "    *   **Selectivity:** It should bind *only* to the intended target and not others, to minimize side effects.\n",
      "    *   **Good Pharmacokinetics (ADMET properties):** The molecule should be absorbable, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the body in a way that allows it to reach the target and be cleared effectively without accumulating to toxic levels.\n",
      "    *   **Synthesizability:** The molecule should be chemically feasible to actually create in a lab.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Iterative Generation and Refinement:** The AI then goes to work, generating a multitude of candidate molecules. These candidates are then evaluated (often using other AI models for property prediction or simulations) against the defined goals. The process can be iterative, with the AI learning from the evaluation results to generate even better molecules in subsequent rounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this a Breakthrough?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** AI can explore millions or billions of potential molecular structures much faster than humans can.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** AI can discover molecular architectures that human chemists might not have conceived of, potentially leading to entirely new classes of drugs.\n",
      "*   **Optimization:** AI can simultaneously optimize multiple properties, a very challenging task for traditional methods.\n",
      "*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** By identifying promising candidates earlier and reducing the number of failed experiments, AI can potentially lower the enormous cost of drug development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Scenario:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a researcher wants to find a new drug for a specific cancer protein.\n",
      "1.  They provide the AI with the 3D structure of the cancer protein.\n",
      "2.  They define the desired properties: high binding affinity to the protein, no binding to other key proteins, and good oral bioavailability.\n",
      "3.  The AI then generates thousands of novel molecular structures, each designed to fit the protein's binding pocket and possess the desired drug-like qualities.\n",
      "4.  These AI-generated molecules are then synthesized and tested in the lab to validate the AI's predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This de novo approach, powered by AI, represents a significant paradigm shift in how we think about creating new medicines.\n",

    "In this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",
